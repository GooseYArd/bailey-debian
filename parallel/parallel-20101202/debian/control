Description: build and execute shell command lines from standard input in parallel
 GNU parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs concurrently locally
 or using remote computers. A job is typically a single command or a
 small script that has to be run for each of the lines in the
 input. The typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list
 of users, a list of URLs, or a list of tables.
